    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">for <strong>Drop It - StickMan</strong></p>
  </header>

  <p>The application <strong>Drop It - StickMan</strong> is developed and published by <strong>SpaceGameGlobal</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “us”). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights. Please replace the bracketed values with your actual information.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect certain information to provide and improve the app. This may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device information:</strong> device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers (if necessary), and related technical data.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> app usage statistics, crash reports, performance metrics, and analytics events.</li>
    <li><strong>Data necessary for app features:</strong> any other information you explicitly provide when using specific features of the app.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect highly sensitive personal data such as government ID numbers, passport information, or financial account details unless explicitly stated and required for a particular feature.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <p>Collected information is used for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the app’s functionality and performance.</li>
    <li>To diagnose and fix technical issues and crashes.</li>
    <li>To analyze user behavior and usage patterns to enhance user experience.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations, if any.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as analytics and crash reporting (for example, Google Analytics for Firebase). These providers process data according to their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect information collected via the app. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure — absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may have certain rights regarding your personal data depending on your location, including the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your data. To exercise these rights or for any privacy-related requests, contact us at the address below.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>The app may include links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>7. Children</h2>
  <p>The app is not directed to children under 13 (or the applicable minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected data from a child, please contact us to request removal.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the bottom of this page. Significant changes may be communicated through the app or via the contact email provided below.</p>
